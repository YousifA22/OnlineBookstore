        search/filter for a book, and edit the book information in the inventory. If the user is signed in as a normal user they can add 
        books to their cart, remove books from their cart, and search/filter for a particular book. Users can purchase books, recommend 
        books based on purchase history, and recommend books based on the purchase history of other users. The final demo is currently
